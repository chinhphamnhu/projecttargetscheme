## Goal:

At the end of the day, we will:

- Understand these Xcode concepts: target, scheme, build setting, workspace.
- Know how to manage these concepts in Xcode.
- Know how to work with `*.plist` and `*.xcconfig`.

## Contents:

I recommend to read the first and the third sections for saving your time. Because these two sections are basic configuring for real project. After that, you can go back to the second section if you really need.

- [x] [Introduce configuring target and builds for an iOS application][Introduce]
- [ ] [Configure targets and builds for an iOS application][Config]
- [ ] [Configure targets and builds for an iOS application with *.xcconfig][ConfigWithXcconfig]
